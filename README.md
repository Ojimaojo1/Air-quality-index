# Air-quality-index
Globally, many cities continuously assess the air quality using various monitoring techniques to record the concentrations of pollutants in the air.
This can be measured with the aid of various machine-learning algorithms. Meanwhile, numerous countries use the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the real-time spreading of information on the quality of air. This analysis involves a modified air quality dataset sourced from GCU Learn (AirQuality.zip), comprising 9358 hourly-averaged readings from 5 metal-oxide chemical sensors within a significantly polluted area in an Italian city.
The objectives of this project include; 


a. To predict CO gas 

b. To define the Air Quality Index and also Predict other Variables.
